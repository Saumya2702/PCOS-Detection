          <h3>What is PCOS?</h3>
          <p>
          Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which the ovaries produce an abnormal amount of androgens, male sex hormones that are usually present in women in small amounts. The name polycystic ovary syndrome describes the numerous small cysts (fluid-filled sacs) that form in the ovaries. However, some women with this disorder do not have cysts, while some women without the disorder do develop cysts.
Ovulation occurs when a mature egg is released from an ovary. This happens so it can be fertilized by a male sperm. If the egg is not fertilized, it is sent out of the body during your period.In some cases, a woman doesn’t make enough of the hormones needed to ovulate. When ovulation doesn’t happen, the ovaries can develop many small cysts. These cysts make hormones called androgens. Women with PCOS often have high levels of androgens. This can cause more problems with a woman’s menstrual cycle. 
And it can cause many of the symptoms of PCOS.Treatment for PCOS is often done with medication. This can’t cure PCOS, but it helps reduce symptoms and prevent some health problems.

          <h3>What causes PCOS?</h3>
          <p>
          The exact cause of PCOS is not clear. Many women with PCOS have insulin resistance. This means the body can't use insulin well. Insulin levels build up in the body and may cause higher androgen levels. Obesity can also increase insulin levels and make PCOS symptoms worse.
          PCOS may also run in families. It's common for sisters or a mother and daughter to have PCOS.Genes, insulin resistance, and inflammation have all been linked to excess androgen production.Studies show that PCOS runs in families.
It's likely that many genes not just one contribute to the condition.Up to 70 percent of women with PCOS have insulin resistance, meaning that their cells can't use insulin properly.
Insulin is a hormone the pancreas produces to help the body use sugar from foods for energy.When cells can't use insulin properly, the body's demand for insulin increases. The pancreas makes more insulin to compensate. Extra insulin triggers the ovaries to produce more male hormones.
Obesity is a major cause of insulin resistance. Both obesity and insulin resistance can increase your risk for type 2 diabetes.
Women with PCOS often have increased levels of inflammation in their body. Being overweight can also contribute to inflammation.Studies have linked excess inflammation to higher androgen levels

          <h3>What are the risks for PCOS?</h3>
          <p>
          You may be more likely to have PCOS if your mother or sister has it. You may also be more likely to have it if you have insulin resistance or are obese.
          Women with PCOS may be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, and endometrial cancer.
The types of treatment for PCOS may depend on whether or not a woman plans to become pregnant. Women who plan to become pregnant in the future may take different kinds of medications.

          <h3>How is PCOS diagnosed?</h3>
          <p>
          Your health care provider will ask about your medical history and your symptoms. You will also have a physical exam. This will likely include a pelvic exam. This exam checks the health of your reproductive organs, both inside and outside your body.
          Some of the symptoms of PCOS are like those caused by other health problems. Because of this, you may also have tests such as:

          <ul>
            <li>
           Ultrasound:  This test uses sound waves and a computer to create images of blood vessels, tissues, and organs. This test is used to look at the size of the ovaries and see if they have cysts. The test can also look at the thickness of the lining of the uterus (endometrium).
            </li>
            <li>
            Blood tests: These look for high levels of androgens and other hormones. Your health care provider may also check your blood glucose levels. And you may have your cholesterol and triglyceride levels checked.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <h3>When should I seek medical care?</h3>
          <p><ul>
          <li> Irregular or absent periods: If you have infrequent periods (fewer than nine per year), very irregular periods (varying lengths between periods), or no periods at all, it's a good idea to see a doctor.</li>
          <li> Signs of excess androgen: This could include excessive hair growth on the face, chest, or abdomen, male-pattern baldness, or severe acne.</li>
          <li>Difficulty getting pregnant: PCOS can make ovulation less regular, which can hinder conception. If you're trying to get pregnant and facing challenges, a doctor can help.</li>
          <li>Weight concerns: PCOS can sometimes make it harder to lose weight or contribute to weight gain. If you're struggling with weight management and suspect PCOS might be a factor, a doctor can offer guidance.</li>
          <li>Other health concerns: PCOS can increase your risk of developing other conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or sleep apnea.</li></ul>
          If you experience symptoms that might be related to these conditions (excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, high blood pressure readings), consulting a doctor is important.
Additionally, it's always a good idea to see a doctor if you have any concerns or questions about PCOS, even if the symptoms listed above don't apply directly to you. Early diagnosis and management can help prevent complications and improve your overall health and well-being.
